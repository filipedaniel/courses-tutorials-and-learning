This is an example of two methods for doing a depth-first traversal
of a directory tree.

traverse.sh uses subshells to traverse each subdirectory.
traverse2.sh uses a single shell, which is probably more efficient.
tree.tar.gz contains a simple directory tree for testing with:
a
a/ac
a/A
a/ad
a/ad/Another File
a/aa
a/aa/AA
a/File With Spaces
a/ab
a/ab/AB
b
b/ba
b/bb
b/B
b/bc
b/bd
c
c/cb
c/C
c/ca
c/cc
c/cd
d
d/D
d/da
d/db
d/db/This is a file
d/dc
d/dd
