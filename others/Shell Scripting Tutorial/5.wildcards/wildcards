how you would copy all the files from /tmp/a into /tmp/b. 
$ cp /temp/a/* /temp/b/

All the .txt files? 
$ cp /temp/a/*.txt /temp/b/

All the .html files? 
$ cp /temp/a/*.html /temp/b/

Now how would you list the files in /tmp/a/ without using ls /tmp/a/? 
How about echo /tmp/a/*? What are the two key differences between this and the ls output? How can this be useful? Or a hinderance? 
> echo show the entire path
